    <h1>First Start Configuration</h1>
    <p>
        Soyuz can auto-detect your 3D printer using Bonjour, also known as zeroconf. An install of Mainsail
        supports zeroconf, but it isn't enabled out of the box and requires a single-line configuration change.
    </p>
    <p>
        To enable zeroconf in Mainsail, locate your <em>moonraker.conf</em> file and add a single entry:
    </p>
    <span>[zeroconf]</span>
    <br/>
    <p>
        This is sufficient to enable zeroconf support, you don't need any additional configuration after this single line.
    </p>
